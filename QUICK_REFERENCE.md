# Quick Reference: GitHub vs Local Development

| Task | Recommended Tool | Why |
|------|-----------------|-----|
| **Quick text edits** (phone numbers, hours, services) | GitHub.dev (press `.` on any page) | Fast, no setup needed, works from anywhere |
| **CSS styling changes** | VS Code + Live Server (local) | See changes instantly in browser |
| **Adding new pages** | VS Code (local) | Test thoroughly before pushing |
| **Reviewing pull requests** | GitHub web interface | Built-in diff viewer and commenting |
| **Fixing typos** | GitHub.dev | Quick and easy |
| **Responsive design testing** | VS Code (local) | Use browser dev tools for different screen sizes |
| **Working from phone/tablet** | GitHub.dev or Codespaces | Browser-based editing |
| **No internet access** | VS Code (local) | Work offline |
| **Learning/experimenting** | Codespaces | Full environment without local installation |
| **Production changes** | Either (test first!) | Both work, choose based on task complexity |
